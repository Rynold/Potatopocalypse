# Potatopocalypse
This is a work in progress 2D Unity Game I was working on. I plan on polishing it up and releasing it eventually when I have time.

Its a classic missile defense game with a twist! Mount potato has erupted  and is now raining dangerous potatoes down on your 
local cave dwellers. Its your job, as a fireball spitting dino, to shoot the potatoes out of the sky before they reach the ground.
Collect power ups and don't miss a shot to keep your score climing higher and higher! Once 3 potatoes hit the ground its game over!
Good Luck!

Some of the classes may be a little messy but for the most part they are easy to follow and I commented where they might not be.
Some highlights are that I am taking advantage of object pooling for the potatoes and the fireballs, also I have four different power-ups
for the player to acquire. 

Red = Shoot three fireballs instead of one.
Blue = Shoot homing fireballs.
Yellow = shoot larger fireballs that leave a pool of hot mash behind.
Green = instantly gain 100 fries.

The game has the start of an achievement system in place as well as a store you can go to in order to upgrade your dino.
